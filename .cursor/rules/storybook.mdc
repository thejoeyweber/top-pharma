description: Rules for Storybook development and component stories

# Story Organization Rules 🏗️
- Stories live in `packages/ui/src/stories/` following component hierarchy:
  - Base components: `stories/ui/`
  - Extended components: `stories/elements/`
  - Composite components: `stories/patterns/`
  - Domain components: `stories/features/`
- Story files must use format: `[component-name].stories.tsx`
- Stories must demonstrate all component variants and states
- Story-specific assets should be placed in `stories/assets/`

# Story Development Rules 🛠️
- Each component requires a corresponding story
- Stories must follow parallel directory structure with components
- All stories must include proper documentation and usage examples

# Story Format Rules 📐
- Use `args` pattern for simple components
- Use `render` function for composite components
- For complex templates with multiple variants, create a template function
- Always use proper component composition reflecting real usage patterns

# Controls Best Practices 🛠️
- For React nodes or complex objects, prefer pre-defined variants over controls
- Use appropriate control types for different prop types:
  - Text controls for strings
  - Boolean controls for flags
  - Select controls for options with predefined values
