# Component Development Rules
- Start with shadcn components from `ui/` directory
- Create elements by extending base components
- Build patterns by combining elements and base components
- Create feature components using patterns and elements
- All new components must use shadcn components as building blocks where applicable

# Story Organization Rules
- Stories live in `packages/ui/src/stories/` following component hierarchy:
  - Base components: `stories/ui/`
  - Extended components: `stories/elements/`
  - Composite components: `stories/patterns/`
  - Domain components: `stories/features/`
- Story files must use format: `[component-name].stories.tsx`
- Stories must demonstrate all component variants and states
- Story-specific assets should be placed in `stories/assets/`

# Story Development Rules
- Each component requires a corresponding story
- Stories must follow parallel directory structure:
  ```
  src/
  ├── components/ui/button.tsx
  └── stories/ui/button.stories.tsx
  ```
- Stories must include:
  - All component variants
  - Interactive controls
  - Proper documentation
