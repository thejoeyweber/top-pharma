# Command Execution Rules üõ†Ô∏è
- Use PowerShell-compatible commands:
  - Use `;` instead of `&&` for command chaining
  - Use `cd` commands separately from other operations
  - Prefix npm/pnpm commands with `npx` when running one-off tools
- When installing packages:
  - Install dependencies from root using `-w` workspace flag
  - Or navigate to specific package directory first, then install
- Always verify component.json configurations before adding new components
- Never run git commands
