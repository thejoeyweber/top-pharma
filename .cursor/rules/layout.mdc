# Layout Structure Rules (`packages/ui`)
- Shared layout components live in `packages/ui/src/components/layouts` (e.g., `DashboardLayout`).
- Implement core UI structure here.

# Layout Implementation Rules (`apps/web`)
- App layout files (`apps/web/app/**/layout.tsx`) are thin wrappers importing shared layouts.
- Handle Next.js specifics (metadata, route group context) here.
- Root layout (`apps/web/app/layout.tsx`) handles global providers, HTML/body, fonts, theme.
- Use route groups `(groupname)` for organization (e.g., `(marketing)`, `(dashboard)`).
