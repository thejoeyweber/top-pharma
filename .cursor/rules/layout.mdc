description: Rules for layout structure and implementation

# Layout Structure Rules 🏗️
- Layout components live in `packages/ui/src/components/layouts`
- Layout components are shared across all applications
- All applications should import layouts from the UI package
- Never duplicate layout components in application code

# Layout Implementation Rules 🛠️
- All layout files in Next.js app routes should be thin wrappers importing from UI package
- Next.js-specific logic stays in app layouts, UI implementation stays in packages
- The Next.js app uses route groups for organization:
  - `apps/web/app/(marketing)/` - Landing pages
  - `apps/web/app/(dashboard)/` - Application pages  
  - `apps/web/app/(auth)/` - Authentication pages
- Route groups with parentheses `(groupname)` don't affect URL paths
