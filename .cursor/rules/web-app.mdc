# Next.js App Router Structure
- The web app uses route groups for organization:
  - `apps/web/app/(marketing)/` - Landing pages
  - `apps/web/app/(dashboard)/` - Application pages  
  - `apps/web/app/(auth)/` - Authentication pages
- Each route group has its own layout component:
  - `apps/web/app/(marketing)/layout.tsx` - Uses LandingLayout
  - `apps/web/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx` - Uses DashboardLayout
  - `apps/web/app/(auth)/layout.tsx` - Uses AuthLayout
- The root layout at `apps/web/app/layout.tsx` contains:
  - Global providers
  - HTML/body tags
  - Font definitions
  - Theme setup
- Route groups with parentheses `(groupname)` don't affect URL paths
