# Command Execution Rules
- Use PowerShell-compatible commands:
  - Use `;` instead of `&&` for command chaining
  - Use `cd` commands separately from other operations
  - Prefix npm/pnpm commands with `npx` when running one-off tools
- When installing packages:
  - Install dependencies from root using `-w` workspace flag
  - Or navigate to specific package directory first, then install
- Always run shadcn commands from `apps/web` directory
- Always verify component.json configurations before adding new components

# Project Structure Rules
- This is a pnpm monorepo using Turborepo
- UI components live in `packages/ui/src/components`
- Next.js app lives in `apps/web`
- All shared components must be added to `packages/ui`, not `apps/web`

# Component Usage Rules
- Always import shared components from `@workspace/ui/components`
- Never duplicate shared components in `apps/web`
- Add new shadcn components using: `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add [component] -c apps/web`

# Component Architecture
- Components are organized in a hierarchy:
  - Base (shadcn): `packages/ui/src/components/ui`
  - Extended: `packages/ui/src/components/elements`
  - Composite: `packages/ui/src/components/patterns`
  - Domain-specific: `packages/ui/src/components/features`
- Never modify shadcn components directly, always extend them
