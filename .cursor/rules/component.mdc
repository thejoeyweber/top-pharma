# Component Development Rules 🏗️
- Never modify shadcn components directly, always extend them
- Start with shadcn base components, then extend as needed
- Export client components as `export const MyComponent`
- Add new shadcn components using: `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add [component] -c apps/web`

# Component Usage Rules 🛠️
- Always import shared components from `@workspace/ui/components`
- Never duplicate shared components in `apps/web`
