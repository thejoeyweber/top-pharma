description: Guidelines for using the reference implementation at `/_reference` as inspiration and acceleration.
---

# Reference Implementation Overview
- The directory `/_reference` contains a prototype implementation
- Use as **inspiration** and **reference** but not for direct copying
- Check for patterns, component structures, and naming conventions

# When To Check Reference Implementation
1. **Creating UI Components**: Check corresponding components in `/_reference/components`
2. **Building Pages**: Review similar pages in `/_reference/app`
3. **Implementing Hooks**: Consider patterns in `/_reference/hooks`
4. **Writing Utility Functions**: Examine approaches in `/_reference/lib`
5. **Styling**: Reference tailwind config and style patterns in `/_reference/styles`

# How To Use References
- **Study, Don't Copy**: Understand the intent and approach
- **Adapt to Project Architecture**: Ensure consistency with monorepo structure
- **Maintain Proper Attribution**: Comment code that's heavily inspired by reference
- **Improve Where Possible**: Update patterns that can be enhanced

# Integration with Project
When adapting from reference:
1. Update imports to use workspace packages (`@workspace/*`)
2. Migrate from single app structure to monorepo structure
3. Ensure components match shadcn/UI patterns in `packages/ui`
4. Convert styling to match project conventions

# Reference Availability Verification
If you don't see the `/_reference` directory, please notify the maintainers.
